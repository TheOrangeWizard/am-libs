# libs
library collection for the advanced macros mod intended for use on https://www.reddit.com/r/civclassics/

put together over the past year or two that i've been using AM, quality varies. use at your own risk.

these should be placed in the /macros/libs/ subdirectory of the advancedmacros folder and can be imported to other scripts by using standard lua syntax: `xyz = require ("xyz")`
